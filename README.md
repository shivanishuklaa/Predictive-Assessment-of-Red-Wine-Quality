# Predictive Assessment of Red Wine Quality 🍷
This project involves predicting the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains 11 input variables related to wine attributes and a target variable representing wine quality.

# 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains 1599 samples with the following features:

Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol, 
Quality (Target variable: Integer between 3 and 8)

# 📦 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly
Tools: Jupyter Notebook

# 📜 Results
Top Features influencing wine quality include alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates.
Models demonstrate a promising baseline performance for quality prediction.
